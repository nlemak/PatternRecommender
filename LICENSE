Ravelry Application Developer and API License Agreement
Version 1.0. Updated January 25th, 2012

Ravelry grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable and restricted license to the
Ravelry Application Program Interface (the “API”) with the right to use the API, as
set forth below, provided that you are and remain at all times in compliance with
the letter and spirit of this license and any requirements set forth in the API
documentation. Any Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning (s)
set forth in the Ravelry Terms of Service.

The purpose of the API is to enable our users to tap into all of the great Content
and Services available on Ravelry, and create great applications for themselves and
other members of the Ravelry community.

With that in mind, you may use the API subject to the following requirements:

Respect for Ravelry
a. You may embed the API (or portions of it) into your applications, if necessary,
but you may not modify, alter, translate, decompile, disassemble, decrypt, extract,
or otherwise reverse engineer the API.
b. Any application that that uses the API must comply fully with Ravelry’s Terms of
Use and Community Guidelines to the extent applicable.
c. The API may only be used for applications whose primary audience is Ravelry Users
unless Ravelry expressly allows otherwise. Ravelry, in its reasonable discretion,
shall be the sole arbiter of your compliance with this requirement. For questions
about this requirement, please contact Ravelry.
d. You may not create the impression that your application has been created by, is
associated with, or is endorsed by Ravelry. Rather, you must make clear at all times
who the provider of the application is, and that it is not Ravelry.
e. You may not use the API to create applications that in any way compete with or
diminish the need for any of Ravelry’s own commercial applications. Ravelry, in its
reasonable discretion, shall be the sole arbiter of your compliance with this requirement.
For questions about this requirement, please contact Ravelry.
f. You may not use the API in any manner which may damage Ravelry’s reputation or
commercial operations. Ravelry, in its reasonable discretion, shall be the sole
arbiter of your compliance with this requirement. For questions, please contact Ravelry.
g. You may only use data and/or Content collected from Ravelry in a manner that is
consistent with Ravelry’s wishes. You will immediately cease use of and destroy any
data or Content that you (i) collected from Ravelry, or (ii) created from or with
the use of any data or Content collected from Ravelry, upon request by Ravelry.
h. You may not sell, rent, sublease redistribute or syndicate access to the API or
any Ravelry data or Content, nor may you enable or encourage others to do so.

Respect for Ravelry’s Users
a. Any application that you create or use with the API must conspicuously disclose to
users how the application collects, stores and uses Ravelry’s users’ Content and/or data.
b. You may only use data and/or Content collected from Ravelry in a manner that is
consistent with the wishes of the owner(s) of that data and/or Content. You will
immediately cease use of and destroy any data or Content that you (i) collected from
Ravelry, or (ii) created from or with the use of any data or Content collected from
Ravelry, if you are requested to do so by that data or Content’s owner.
c. You may only store Ravelry users’ data or Content for as long as is necessary to
provide the service you are providing with your application.

Miscellaneous
a. Ravelry may from time to time revise or update the API and/or any documentation
included with the API, at its option,
b. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ravelry is under no obligation to maintain or update
the API. Ravelry may discontinue the API at its sole discretion.
c. Nothing contained herein shall give you any ownership rights to any data or Content
found on Ravelry.
d. Ravelry will not be liable for any damages of any kind, including, without limitation,
direct, indirect, incidental, punative and consequential damages, arising out of or in
connection with your use of, or inability to use the API.
e. Your use of the API is at your sole risk. The API is provided on an “As Is” and
“As Available” basis. Ravelry makes no warranty that the API will meet your requirements
or expectations, or will be available uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free,
Without limiting the foregoing, Ravelry expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind,
whether express or implied including, but not limited to the implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement.
f. The API shall be considered a Service, as defined in the Ravelry Terms of Service.
Any provisions in the Terms of Service that may apply to the API, but that are not
expressly set forth herein, shall be considered to be incorporated herein by reference.
